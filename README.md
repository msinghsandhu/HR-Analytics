# HR-Analytics

The HR analytics Power BI project aims to leverage data-driven insights to enhance human resource management practices within the organization. This involves analyzing various HR metrics and KPIs to optimize recruitment, retention, performance evaluation, and overall employee satisfaction.

The project involves gathering data from multiple sources such as HRIS (Human Resources Information System), employee surveys, performance evaluations, and other relevant systems.

Utilizing Power BI's robust visualization capabilities, interactive dashboards are developed to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights into HR metrics. These dashboards typically include key metrics like employee turnover rates, recruitment effectiveness, training and development ROI, diversity and inclusion statistics, and performance evaluations.

Through advanced analytics techniques, the project identifies trends and patterns within HR data. Predictive modeling may also be employed to forecast future HR outcomes such as attrition rates, identify flight risk among employees, and predict recruitment needs based on business growth projections.

The project involves segmenting employees based on various criteria such as department, tenure, performance, and demographics. This segmentation allows for personalized HR strategies tailored to different employee groups, fostering a more targeted approach to talent management and employee engagement initiatives.

The HR analytics Power BI project is iterative in nature, continuously refining analytics models and dashboards based on feedback and changing organizational needs. Insights generated from the project serve as a foundation for evidence-based decision-making within HR and broader organizational strategies, ultimately driving improvements in workforce productivity, morale, and overall organizational performance.
